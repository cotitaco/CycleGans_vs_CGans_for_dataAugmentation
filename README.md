# CycleGans_vs_CGans_for_dataAugmentation
This repository contains all the notebooks and datasets used to conduct the expetiment of comparing which type of GAN is more efficient to conduct Data Augmentation from conditional entries. Due to the nature of datasets you will be able to find all of the required datasets by clicking this link https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ar9hEjcPB2vDhet0ZtVaRzh4LYzbPw?e=isLJG62. The pipeline folder contains all the jupyter notebooks I used to train my models. The FID folder referes to my evaluation metric Frechets Index Distance, this folder contains the notebooks I used to compare my results.
